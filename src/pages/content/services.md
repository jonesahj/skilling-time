### For corporates and professionals
I run bespoke workshops and coaching programs for corporates who want to encourage their employees to do good through pro bono work. I can help employees understand how pro bono can boost their career, identify the valuable skills they have to give and support them to translate these skills to a not-for-profit setting. 

This workshop is particularly useful for workplaces that offer a certain number of volunteering days to each employee or are committed to supporting employees in pursuing pro bono pursuits alongside their day job.

Get in touch <amanda@skillingtime.co.uk> to talk about the opportunities for you and your employees.

### For charities and social enterprises
I am an Advertising Strategist with 15 years experience working for big household brands. For the last seven years I have done a mixture of pro bono and low bono work alongside my day job, which I absolutely love. I am now really lucky to have a four day a week job so I have one day a week to do pro bono and low bono work with causes I really care about. Any  profit I make is put into running Skilling Time. All I ask in return is that you tell any professionals you know about Skilling Time and help spread the word!  

If you are a for good organisation looking for strategy, marketing or branding support please get in touch at <amanda@skillingtime.co.uk> and we can discuss options.
