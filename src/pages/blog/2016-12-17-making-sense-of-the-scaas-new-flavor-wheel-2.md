### Working out how much time you want to give 

People often worry about how they will fit pro bono work into their already busy lives, and so, much like learning a new language or reading War and Peace, it stays on the bucket list. I started doing pro bono work when I was working full-time. Granted I don’t have kids, but I do have a lot of other hobbies and interests that I’ve kept going whilst doing pro bono too. For me doing a few hours here and there where I could fit it in during my week worked best; an hour or two in a cafe on a Sunday morning with a tasty coffee by my side, on tedious train rides to out of town work meetings and sometimes in the pub on a weekday evening (although I quickly learnt one drink is the max I can imbibe and still do good work, tipsyness = very sloppy typing).  Other people like having fixed times that they do pro bono work, much like having a gym routine. And try talking to your boss about doing some pro bono work during work hours, I agreed that I could spend a day a month on pro bono work, allowing me to host workshops during work hours, when my brain was at its best. Other employers (the awesome ones) give employees a certain number of days a year to do volunteering work, and pro bono work is a great way to use those days.

There are many different types of pro bono opportunities, so no matter your time wealth, there will be ways for you to fit pro bono into your life. 

Lowest time commitment: 1 hour - 2 days
If you know you can’t commit very much time then one-off pro bono events are best for you. Many organisations host events and workshops that bring together professionals and social good organisations to solve a specific problem or to swap skills. Bigger companies may organise these for you, or be open to you arranging one at your workplace.

Medium time commitment: 1 week - 3 months 
If you’d like to have a greater impact then getting involved with a specific project is a better option. There’s still a clear end-point, making it easier to plan into your life, but you are getting involved in the doing and can really put your skills to good use. Charities are often looking for professionals to help them on a specific project, like creating social media content or to meet certain objectives or deadlines, say around their annual planning cycle. This means you have a really clear understanding of how you can have an impact, and what’s expected of you. With these project based opportunities make sure you are clear on the time scale, as that will help you work out how many hours a week you will need to dedicate to it. Some projects can be quite time intensive over a short period, others require a small amount of work over a longer time.

Longer time commitment: 1 - 3 years 
Some professionals enjoy being connected to a socially good organisation for a longer time period, as you really get to know the organisation, develop strong relationships and see the difference you are making first hand. These roles are often more advisory in nature too, meaning they may take less hours per week than helping out on a specific project. You could mentor someone with a similar role to you. Or you could take on a role as an advisor, providing advice based on your area of expertise. You or even join their board as a trustee, governor or director (these roles are all fairly similar, the term changes with the financial structure of the organisation). As a non-exec board member your duty is to strategically oversee the organisation's work, to ensure it is having the most possible social impact. The most time intensive option is to take on a permanent pro bono role. This is often taken on by people who are between jobs, or returning to employment, as few can give so much of their time for free, hats off to those who can! If you embark on any of these roles I’d suggest staying in post for at least a year, which is why I’ve categorised them as longer time commitment options, despite it likely being less hours per month than the medium length options. Just like in regular employment it takes a while to get to grips with the role and provide valuable contributions as a mentor or advisor.

After reading the above do you have an idea as to which level of commitment would suit you best? Or perhaps you’ve realised you don’t really mind about the time commitment, and the cause you are working with is more important. 

Think about how much time you have to give (a weekly average is a good way to quantify it)
Think about how long you’d like to be connected to a charity for
