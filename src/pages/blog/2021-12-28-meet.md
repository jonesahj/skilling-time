This daytime event has a smaller group size, so we can get through the content more quickly. Good for parents and those who can make time in their working day.

Meet other ambitious professionals who are interested in doing good with their day job through pro bono work.

* Understand how pro bono can help your career 
* Identify the valuable skills you have to give
* Translate your skills to a not-for-profit setting
* Design your ideal pro bono experience

By the end of the session you will have all the know-how you need to start a pro bono project with a cause you care about.

Cost: Â£50 (all profits donated to charity, you as a workshop attendee got to decide the charity)
