#### Mentoring counts as pro bono work

When you mentor someone you use your professional experiences to help someone else achieve workplace goals or overcome challenges. That's a form of offering your professional skills free of charge. 

#### What's in this episode of Time to Skill

I talk to Jutta Nedden, a workplace mediator and leadership coach with 15 years experience working with leaders of large international commercial and charity organisations. Alongside her day job she regularly mentors charity managers and leaders, supporting them to navigate conflict and tension within their organisations. 

Jutta draws on her wealth of experience as a trained coach, sharing how a mentoring relationship can be rewarding for both you and your mentee. She also shares how mentoring influenced her own professional development and inspired her to found her own business.
