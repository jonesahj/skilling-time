In this interview I talk to Charly Young, CEO, Founder and with an MBE to boot. She runs the Girls Network, an award-winning charity that matches girls from the least advantaged communities with a female mentor, in order to open opportunities that the girls would otherwise not have access to. 

We chat about how the best pro bono experiences are ones that feel like a meeting of experts; the professional is an expert in their skill area and the charity is an expert in their area of impact. And it is this sense of equality and learning on both sides that makes it particularly rewarding and successful.
